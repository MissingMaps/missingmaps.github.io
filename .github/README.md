- **Ruby gems**: Weekly updates on Sundays  
- **GitHub Actions**: Weekly updates on Sundays
- **Grouping**: Development vs production dependencies
- **Auto-assignment**: PRs assigned to maintainers

## Migration from Travis CI

This setup replaces the previous Travis CI configuration with modern GitHub Actions:
- âœ… Improved security with GitHub's built-in secrets management
- âœ… Better integration with GitHub features
- âœ… More granular control over workflows
- âœ… Built-in GitHub Pages deployment
- âœ… Automated dependency management

## Required Secrets

No additional secrets are required - GitHub Actions uses built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for deployment.

## Branch Strategy

- **`publish`**: Production deployment branch (auto-deploys to GitHub Pages)
- **`main`/`master`**: Development branch (tests only)
- **Feature branches**: Pull request testing only
