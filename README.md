## [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org/)


### Adding events

Events are stored in the `app/_data` folder. To add an event, edit the events.csv. 

When updating the csv of events: 

- Use `yyyy-mm-dd` format for date. The year must be 4 digits (may need to adjust display settings in Microsoft Excel). Otherwise, 15 may be interpreted as 1915 instead of 2015.

```
new Date("9/15/15")
Date 1915-09-15T04:00:00.000Z
new Date("9/15/2015")
Date 2015-09-15T04:00:00.000Z
```
- Fields can be left blank if data does not exist or is TBD

- Include the two letter country code to include the correct flag

## Development 

### Environment
To set up the development environment for this website, you'll need to install the following on your system:

- [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org/)
- Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), preferably through something like [rvm](https://rvm.io/)
- Gulp ( $ npm install -g gulp )

After these basic requirements are met, run the following commands in the website's folder:
```
$ npm install
```
Will also run `bundle install`

### Getting started

```
$ gulp serve
```
Compiles the compass files, javascripts, and launches the server making the site available at `http://localhost:3000/`
The system will watch files and execute tasks whenever one of them changes.
The site will automatically refresh since it is bundled with livereload.

The `_config-dev.yml` file will be loaded alongside `_config.yml`.

### Other commands
Clean the compiled site. I.e. the `_site` folder
```
$ gulp clean
```

Compile the compass files, javascripts, and builds the jekyll site using `_config-dev.yml`.
Use this instead of ```gulp serve``` if you don't want to watch.
```
$ gulp
```

Compiles the site loading the `_config-stage.yml` alongside `_config.yml`. The javascript files will be minified.
```
$ gulp stage
```

Compiles the site loading the `_config-prod.yml` alongside `_config.yml`. The javascript files will be minified.
```
$ gulp prod
```

### Graphics

Illustrator files for the sites graphics can be found in the MissingMaps repository. They are made in CC 2015.

Badge graphics can be found in the Users repository.

The font used for the graphics & most of the site is [Hind](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Hind). For the graphics with text on them, they've been converted to outlines.
