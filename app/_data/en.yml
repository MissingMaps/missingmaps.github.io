Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from open and accessible maps and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project in which you can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of people who live at risk of disasters and crises."

  title:        "Field Mapping"
  intro1: "So you’ve mapped an area as best you can from satellite imagery, now you want to map your community more in detail. Curious about what to do next? This section of the site will help you navigate planning, carrying out, and processing a community mapping activity."
  intro2: "The end goal of this activity is to capture the perspective of unique places and people on the map. To do this, ideally you need a diverse community of mappers who can represent the voices of the locality. Establishing a sustainable culture of mapping takes time and effort and there are many steps you can take to get this started, grow and nurture a community."
  intro3: "Reminder: this is not intended to be a comprehensive guide, but instead to help get you started."
  volunteers-header: "OpenStreetMap is built by volunteers"
  volunteers-description: "OpenStreetMap is built by volunteers who care about places. Unlike many other mapping platforms profit is not the driving factor to create data. Individuals all have unique perspectives on our surroundings and this is when OSM comes alive, when the color of a community is added. A map will only be as good as the depth and breadth of the voices consulted to populate it. Local knowledge is fundamental to creating a comprehensive and sustainable resource by and for your community. Including the wider community and ensuring their involvement in your project is key."
  before-header: "Before you start mapping"
  before-description: "Before you start mapping, it’s important to assess things like community participation, safely, tool usages, and long term data maintenance. We know you can’t wait to dive in, but first consider:"
  privacy-header: "Privacy:"
  privacy-about: "Should this area be mapped in a public facing way? Despite your best intentions, it is important to consider if and how spatial information can be used against the community you would like to map. Many communities world-wide are accustomed to having detailed public maps of their area. However, even having the absolute minimal information made public can be dangerous for some communities. Other communities may be comfortable with some information being made public but not all. Although you will never get a full consensus from every community member, it is important to consider this at all stages of your work."
  physicalsafety-header: "Physical Safety:"
  physicalsafety-about: "During data collection, people sometimes get caught up in the mapping and forget about what’s going on in their surroundings. Keep your safety in mind and consider the following:"
  physicalsafety-list:
    - label: "Be aware of your surroundings! Don’t keep your eyes glued to your clipboard or phone."
    - label: "Some areas may be more dangerous than others. Consider when and where mappers will be welcome in certain areas. [A.] If possible, consider having a community escort and consulting a local to find out where unsafe locations are. [B.] Make sure your mappers can quickly explain your project to community members if asked. [C.] Is your organization branding known in the community? If so, make sure your mappers are easily identified as part of your group with visible logos etc."
    - label:  "Keep a list of all your mappers, where they are going, and their contact information. If someone gets lost, you’ll need to know how to find them! [A.] The buddy system is always encouraged. [B.] Can your mappers get in touch with the project organizers while out and about in the community? If there isn’t cell service in the area, consider walkie talkies. [C.] Encourage your mappers to pack external batteries as mapping can drain a phone quickly! [D.] Plan to check on each group at least a couple times a day if out for long periods."
    - label:  "Can some of your electronic equipment be left in the office? Don’t make yourself more of a target for theft than necessary."
    - label:  "How will your mappers get to their project site? If leaving them behind, consider having a safe meeting spot preassigned in case they need somewhere to pause while waiting for you to get them."
    - label:  "Do your mappers have enough food/water for the day?"
    - label:  "Do your mappers have sun / cold / rain protection?"

mapswipe:
  title:    "MapSwipe"
  intro1:   "With your mobile phone, you can play a part in helping communities around the world, one swipe at a time."
  intro2:   "Around the world, millions of individuals are affected by disasters, disease, and conflict. First responders working with these communities often have to cover large areas, but lack the data necessary for an efficient, effective response. Through MapSwipe, volunteers pinpoint where critical infrastructure and populations are located, allowing mappers to focus only on areas where they know features need to be mapped."
  intro3:   "MapSwipe is an open-source mobile app that is making mapping around the world more coordinated and efficient. Volunteers swipe through satellite images looking for features (ie: buildings, roadways, waterways, etc.) and tap once when they have located them. Each set of imagery is viewed by at least three different individuals to create a mechanism for internal validation of results. We believe that anyone, anywhere should be able to contribute to the Missing Maps project. "
  before: "This would be a huge area for people to map."
  after: "This is the result of MapSwipe. Much better."
  how-section:  "How to use MapSwipe"
  how-intro: "MapSwipe is very intuitive. Mappers follow these steps:"
  how-list:
    - label: "Choose your 'mission'. Each mission will indicate what you are looking for (for example, buildings and roads)."
    - label: "Swipe left to see the next tile."
    - label: "Tap once on a square to identify a feature. The square will turn green."
    - label: "Tap twice if you are not sure, but you think there is a feature. The square will turn orange."
    - label: "Tap three times to identify bad / no imagery or cloud cover. The square will turn red."
  how-end: "Since its start in 2015, MapSwipe has scaled to 29,000 users mapping 600,000 km2 (larger than the area of Kenya). MapSwipe is volunteer-driven and community-led. Any organization or mapping community can request to use MapSwipe to help with their activities on the ground. To learn more check out the <a href=\"https://mapswipe.org/\">MapSwipe website </a>.

Up-to-date maps are important for the success of many humanitarian initiatives around the world in responding to disasters. Through Missing Maps, you can volunteer your time to help inform these maps, and have a real impact on the delivery of healthcare and other services in these communities.

The data produced in OSM, whether by us or other mappers, is used in real time. Therefore, it is important that we properly support these new mappers. Without proper training, supervision and data clean-up, new mappers can have a lot of fun but leave a huge mess behind in OSM! Because of this, we highly recommend you start with smaller events and build your capacity before holding big mapathons. We suggest a first time mapathon host to start by organizing an event for 20 -25 participants. If you are considering a larger event (for 50+ participants) please contact info@hotosm.org. If you are looking to host a bigger event and do not have time to build your training capacity, please consider hosting a <a href=\"https://www.missingmaps.org/mapswipe/\">MapSwipe</a> event instead. These events can more easily involve larger groups responsibly."

  title: "Learn to Validate"
  intro: "Validation is an important part of the Missing Maps process. Getting a second, third, or fourth pair of eyes on mapped features goes a long way in ensuring the quality of data being added to OpenStreetMap and being used in vulnerable communities around the world. Validating requires confidence in your mapping abilities as well as the willingness to help coach and advise newer mappers. The Missing Maps Project is a community of mappers with different levels of mapping experience, all who have a common goal of improving the availability of quality data for humanitarian use."

  steps:
    goal: "Validators"
    step1: "Step 1"
    step1_subtitle: "Identify if becoming a validator is right for you."
    step1_text: "Validating isn’t for everyone; validation requires patience and attention to detail. Some experience mapping in OpenStreetMap and HOT projects is a must, but don’t feel that you need to be an expert to start. If you’re new to Missing Maps or OpenStreetMap mapping in general, head over to our <a href= \"/beginner\"> resources for new mappers. </a> Check out our <a href= \"/assets/downloads/MissingMaps_validation_faq_en.pdf\"> Validation FAQs </a> to gain some insight on what validating entails."
    step1_text2: "If you’ve mapped before using iD Editor, make sure to check out our <a href= \"/advanced\"> advanced mapping section </a> to get started with JOSM first. Validating in iD Editor is possible, but it’s best to use JOSM."
    step2: "Step 2"
    step2_subtitle: "Build your skills."
    step2_text: "Becoming a more efficient mapper is crucial to becoming a validator. The <a href=\"https://josm.openstreetmap.de/\">JOSM Editor</a> is a customizable editor for OpenStreetMap with a number of tools and plugins to make mapping and validating easier!

    step3: "Step 3"
    step3_subtitle: "Collaborate as part of the broader community."
    step3_text: "Different validators have different techniques for validating. Join the conversation on the <a href=\"http://slack.hotosm.org\">HOTOSM Slack</a> validation channel or reach out on the <a href=\"https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/hot\"> HOT Mailing List </a>. Contribute resources that you find helpful and give back to the community! Being a part of the Missing Maps community means working together in a positive and inclusive environment; when giving feedback to mappers, be sure to keep a positive tone and stay mindful of their contributions and desire to help - it’s what keeps OSM growing!"
    step4: "Step 4"
    step4_subtitle: "Validation FAQs"
    faq:
      question1: "<b>How do I know when I'm ready to validate?<b>"
      answer1: "After you’ve had some experience mapping, you may find yourself correcting other contributors' work. When you find that you are doing this on a regular basis, and you are finding it easier to spot and correct the mistakes, you might be interested in becoming a validator. Validating is not to every person's liking but reach out to the HOTOSM community and ask for guidance! We’re happy to help!"
      question2: "<b>Can I validate with iD Editor?<b>"
      answer2: "Yes you can, but it is a lot more difficult to catch all the errors. JOSM Editor has a lot more tools that help new validators find the errors and also to fix some of them, so it is preferable that you learn to map with JOSM first."
      question3: "<b>How do I get started validating?<b>"
      answer3: "The first thing you need to do is learn about what validating is. The <a href=\"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Tasking_Manager/Validating_data\">Validating Data</a> wiki is a great place to start. You’ll want to learn to edit using the <a href=\"https://josm.openstreetmap.de/\">JOSM Editor</a>. JOSM has a number of very useful validation tools which can make the process much easier and more efficient."
      question4: "<b>What are the steps when validating a project?<b>"
      answer4: "The first thing to do is carefully read the instructions for the project you are going to validate so that you understand what the mappers are being asked to do. When checking out each task, do a quick once-over to size up the quality of the mapping. Change or modify what is not in line with the provided instructions, and depending on the amount of time you have available, either complete the task to how it should be mapped or invalidate and leave a constructive comment on why you are invalidating."
      question5: "<b>How do I know the task is mapped well enough?<b>"
      answer5: "Before you start validating check out the <i>instructions</i> tab on the project. See what the requesting organization is looking for (buildings, buildings and roads, roads, landuse, etc.). When you check out a task make sure that everything being requested is mapped. If looking at buildings make sure they are all squared (corners right angles) or circled, depending on the shape. Do this on a building by building basis as not every building will need squared edges. Make sure every feature is tagged, not just <i>area=yes</i>."
      question6: "<b>How should I be tagging roads?<b>"
      answer6: "Typically, most HOTOSM tasks will request that you follow the <a href=\"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa\">Highway Tag Africa Wiki</a>. This is due to the road conditions in African countries not always corresponding to their economic and social role. A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of a road."
      question7: "<b>Should I just review the task and invalidate or should I finish the task and validate?<b>"
      answer7: "This ultimately depends on how much time you have to validate. If you open the task and it’s obvious that the instructions weren’t followed and there are a lot of features that remain unmapped, then invalidate. If the task is complete but just needs some cleaning up (i.e. squared buildings, adding one or two more buildings) then it is advised that you fix what needs to be fixed in the task, and leave a detailed comment for the user who marked it as done including ways that this task could have been mapped better."
      answer7_2: "Use <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/TheMissingMaps/\">this resource</a> to see examples of structures in some of our frequent project areas."
      answer7_3: "Use these guides to see examples of road features around the world: <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa\">African Highways Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway\"> General Highway Guide</a>.  Note, images and descriptions might be helpful even if not mapping in that specific area. Note, road surface materials used doesn't always convey the importance of a route.  Please keep in mind context as well as materials when tagging roads."
      question8: "<b>What sort of feedback should I give?<b>"
      answer8: "<b>Timely, positive, and constructive.</b> Many projects are mapped by beginners at mapathons. Please remember that <b>we were all new mappers at one point, and consider how your tone could impact the decision of a mapper to return to map again.</b> If you find a number of tasks that have been completed by the same mapper, you only need to tag them in the comment once or twice. If the contribution by the mapper is over 2 weeks old, it is not necessary to tag the user. "
      answer8_instructions: "When leaving a comment, please tag the mapper in the comment using the “@” key. See some examples of useful comments below:"
      answer8_example1: "<b>Well-mapped task (Validated):</b> Hi @user, thanks for contributing! Everything here looks great!"
      answer8_example2: "<b>When a very new mapper is good, let them know!</b> Good work @user. You are correctly identifying the buildings/roads from the background imagery and mapping them at the correct size and shape.  Thank you for your time (or Thank you for contributing to this Project). Please keep mapping!"
      answer8_example3: "<b>Okay-mapped task (Validated):</b> Hi @user, thanks for contributing! I found a few additional buildings/roads that could be mapped here, so I went ahead and mapped them. Also, please be sure to square your buildings, which can be done by pressing `Q` in both iD editor and JOSM. I finished everything up here. Thanks again!"
      answer8_example4: "<b>Poorly-mapped task (Invalidated):</b> Hi @user, thanks for contributing! It looks like there are quite a few buildings left to map here. Make sure if the task isn’t complete, to click \"No\" under the Task Status in response to \"Is this task completely mapped?\". If you have questions about what should be mapped, check out the instructions tab. Please reach out if you have any questions!"
      question9: "<b>Should I validate roads on a buildings project?<b>"
      answer9: "Please focus on validating the key features for that specific project. It’s important to read the Project Manager's instructions first so you understand what the mapper's goal was. However if you spot a small change that could be tweaked we appreciate your map stewardship. If large changes need to be made on other features, the best way to do this is via a separate task with corresponding instructions. Such a project may already exist! If you can’t find a corresponding task, please reach out to the project PM directly if you notice large changes that need to be made in that project area."
      question10: "<b>What JOSM plugins are most useful for validating?<b>"
      answer10: "Plugins are tools that must be added using the preferences dialogue box. Pull down the edit menu, click on preferences and click on the electric cord/wall outlet. Here are plugins that we suggest for JOSM mapping/editing/validating: apache-commons; auto-tools; buildings_tools; ejml; geotools; imagery_offset_db; jaxb; jts; mapwithai; opendata; scripting; todo; utilsplugin2."
      question11: "<b>Should I delete poorly drawn features?<b>"
      answer11: "Where possible, it is encouraged to fix poorly drawn features rather than deleting and redrawing them. This is done to preserve the edit history of the feature. There is an easy way to do this with the UtilsPlugin2 by using the <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/utilsplugin2#Replace_geometry_.28Ctrl.2BShift.2BG.29\">Replace Geometry Tool.</a> In some cases, it is more work than it is worth to fix features and the only practical solution is to delete them and redraw. Before deleting features, always ensure that it was not created by a local mapper! Check on the date of the mapping and if the changeset comment links to a mapathon using the Object History function in JOSM."
      question12: "<b>I notice that some projects limit who can validate. What does this mean?<b>"
      answer12: "Some projects are available for validation by intermediate or advanced mappers. Other projects require that you join a validation team. To the right under the Teams and Permissions section in the Tasking Manager is a link to join the teams that are approved for that specific project.  HOT manages a global team of validators that many of the response projects on the Tasking Manager require you to join. To join, please follow the instructions below or use <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HOTValidators\">this link</a> to connect with the team manager."
